load data fro train.csv and labels from other csv

Spliting training features into 2 classes.
-------------------
Put 1st value of 1 feature in class_1_train if trainy 1st value is 1. Otherwise
Put it in class_2_train.
#
Calculating mean and standard deviation of each class saperately.
class_1_train and class_2_train

Predict target class (guess_trainy)
get first row (document features) from train. For each element calculate log of  pdf (normal distribution) add them. One time using class 1 mean and standard deviation and another time using class 2 mean and standard deviation. Assign 1 to guess_trainy if sum in 1st calculation is greater otherwise assign 0.

Calculate accuracy as usual. it should be 91 or greater.

Just do the same for test data Just repeat steps in bold.
accuracy should be 87.98 or better
